Artificial Inteligence for Texas Hold'em

It's a submission for http://robopoker.org/ Texas Hold'em bot tournament. My bot receives POST petitions with the hand and table info, which is handled by a Flask server (webBot.py).

For comparisions and hand-rank, I use Peter Norvig's code (poker.py)

I will implement some learning techniques later, because at this moment the bot only uses a Montecarlo approach to calculate the strenght of its hand.
